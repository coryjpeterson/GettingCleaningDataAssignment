This document outlines the R code created to complete the programming project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class offered by John Hopkins University offered through Coursera.org.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

There are three files associated with the assignment and attached in the Git repo.  

The files are:
- README.md: this file
- CodeBook.md: a description file that outlines variables, the data, and any transformation conducted to clean up the data set.
- run_analysis.R: the program that cleans the data set.

The data set linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Input: The run_analysis.R program must be run in the UCI HAR Dataset folder of the data set provided above.  This directory contains the README.txt file for the data.

Output: Two data frames (cleandata, and cleandatasummary) and a txt file (SummaryTidyData.txt.)
  The data frames structure and contents are described in the CodeBook.md document.
